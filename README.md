# Up for a challenge? ðŸŽ®

This is the repo for my challenge generating website, simply head to https://random-game-challenge.vercel.app/ input your steam id and try ro beat some AI generated challenges!

## How does this work?

Basically it uses the public Steam api to fetch games played by the user, it also sorts them by hours played so you don't get any of those _really weird_ games.
After that, it makes a api call to the Gemini generative ai and prompts it to create some challenges!

### Have fun!
